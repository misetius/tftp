Communism is a socio-political and economic ideology that advocates for a classless society in which the means of production are collectively owned. 
It is rooted in the principles of common ownership, abolition of private property, and equal distribution of wealth. 
Communism has been both a theoretical concept and a practical political system implemented in various forms throughout history.

The foundations of communist thought can be traced back to early utopian socialist ideas, but it was Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels who systematically formulated the ideology in the 19th century.
Their work, The Communist Manifesto (1848), laid the groundwork for modern communism. 
Marx argued that history is defined by class struggles, particularly between the bourgeoisie (owners of capital) and the proletariat (working class). 
 According to Marxist theory, capitalism inevitably leads to the exploitation of workers, economic inequality, and social unrest, which would ultimately result in a proletarian revolution, leading to the establishment of a communist society.
